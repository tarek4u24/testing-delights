# 🧪 Testing Delights  
Automation & Performance Testing Showcase

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository is a hands-on showcase of my skills in **automation** and **performance testing**, built with the mindset of continuous improvement. It’s designed to evolve over time—from simple implementations to robust, scalable frameworks that reflect real-world testing needs.

Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow tester, you're welcome to explore the code, follow the roadmap, and see how I approach testing challenges with clarity and care.

## 🛠️ Current Focus

- ✅ Build a modular Automation & Performance Testing Framework  
- 🧩 Practice against real-world APIs and backend systems  
- 🚀 Demonstrate CI/CD readiness and Docker integration  
- 📈 Explore dynamic data generation, assertion strategies, and test structure best practices  

## 📌 Project Roadmap

- 📋 **Kanban Board**: [Feature Tracker & Roadmap](https://github.com/users/tarek4u24/projects/1)  
  Follow my progress, planned features, and testing milestones.

- 🧠 **Philosophy**:  
  > “Get it working first. Then iterate, polish, and scale.”  
  I believe in starting simple and refining over time. This project reflects that mindset—each commit is a step toward mastery.
